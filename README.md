# Reddit Poster Bot in Python

Self-explanatory: automates the process of posting to several subreddits at once.

Do this by downloading the repo and editing the code in script.py to feature your own credentials. You can obtain app credentials by creating an app here (select type as "script"): https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/

## Installation

Run the code in the command line by running "python script.py" after cd-ing into the project directory. Check the Reddit account's "posts" section to make sure it was submitted.
